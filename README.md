# PyCity_Analysis

## Overview of Project 
Develop insights that will be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. Analyze data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. Aggregate the reading and math scores to showcase any trends in school performance.

## Analysis and Challenges 
- Collect student data int a DataFrame 
- Prepare a clean version of the DataFram 
- Summarize key pieces of the data 
- Drill down into the data to analyze subsets. 
- Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions. 

## Analysis Summary 
The school budget for public schools is about 4.5% larger than charter schools. The Charter schools scores are slightly higher even with smaller budgets. 

It would be good to do a student enrollment know if class size has any impact on grades. It would also be good to know the cost spend per student in to know if budget dollars per student have any significant difference. Knowing what the curve looks like per school could help identify any outliers.
